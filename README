NAMING CONVENTIONS


CATEGORIES AND SUBCATEGORIES

each directory name represents a category;
sub-directories are refinements of a category
each directory may contain images for that category, and/or more sub-directories. The deeper an image is placed, the more accurately it is labeled.

ORIENTATIONS AND COMPONENTS

foo_of_bar			- foo is a component of bar
backleft_of_bar		- backview view of bar
frontright_of_bar	- front-right view of bar

in the 'motor_vehicle'category, 8 views of 'any vehicle' are given -
then there are directories for specific types of vehicle, without the views
these are seperate crops, so no information is repeated.
view or category could be calculated without knowing the either

In the 'person' category, similar is done: there are 8-views of 'any type of person', the just 'front'/'back' X 'man'/'woman' (i.e. accurate angle could be calculated independently of gender).  'front_of_man' really means front_left|front_right|front, etc.
